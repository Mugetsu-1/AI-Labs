Algorithm Overview

   1. Initialize the board with 9 empty spaces.

   2. Display board positions for the player's reference.

   3. Loop through turns until a win or tie occurs:

        AI makes its move based on priority:

            Win if possible.

            Block the opponent if they can win next.

            Take center if available.

            Choose a corner.

            Choose any available space.

        Check for AI win or tie.

        Human player inputs a move.

        Check for player win or tie.

   4.  After a game ends, ask to play again.

   5.  If user chooses not to continue, exit the game.

pseudo code: 

FUNCTION PlayGame():
    INIT board with 9 empty cells
    SET AI = 'X', Human = 'O'
    WHILE True:
        CALL AI_Move(board, AI, Human)
        IF AI wins OR board is full: END game

        CALL Human_Move(board, Human)
        IF Human wins OR board is full: END game

FUNCTION AI_Move(board, AI, Human):
    TRY to win
    ELSE block Human win
    ELSE take center
    ELSE take corner
    ELSE take any empty spot

FUNCTION Human_Move(board, Human):
    LOOP UNTIL valid move:
        GET input and apply move

FUNCTION IsWinner(board):
    CHECK all win patterns

FUNCTION Main():
    LOOP:
        CALL PlayGame()
        IF user says no: EXIT
